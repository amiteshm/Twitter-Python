I posted tweet by two method 1st I downloade python library "python-tweeter",
After downloding and installing It I got error pointing that there is no module name "oAuth".
First things comes to our mind is .. What is OAuth ???
It is nothing but a Open Authentication protocol which is being widely adopted .
To name few Yahoo and Twitter require OAuth autentication to use it’s services . 
Say you have a twitter account . There is another website X which wants to access your tweets .
Then the website X should know your login credentials . In order to over come this OAuth was introduced .
With OAuth the website X can be authorized and it can access the twitter account with the access token given to it.
The advantage is private information can be accessed by other applications without knowing the password and with only access token.
I also installed oauth,simplejson and httplib to avoid further errors
1) Now to begin with we first need to create Application Key. I Visited this website http://dev.twitter.com/apps/new
  and creted a app with name "Amitesh_twit " and then I got these information there
	API Key-9uya1BgKAEJr7JHS1PgirA
	consumer key-9uya1BgKAEJr7JHS1PgirA
	consumer secret-3fakoGCco3Y0BMbLGbedlhlp5FL5eTDWellwmpI57u8
	Request token URL-https://api.twitter.com/oauth/request_token
	Access token URL-https://api.twitter.com/oauth/access_token
	Authorize URL-https://api.twitter.com/oauth/authorize
2)I also install parallelly I install library Tweepy,as it was too complicated to get Access token key,Access token secret.
  I used twitter_api.py file attached to get key and secret.
3)After I running this file I went to url mantioned on terminal "Please authorize: 
  http://api.twitter.com/oauth/authorize?oauth_token=hqggysIf57nme9i3Y6vSkPi3UPNkORJyDse6GSW5Fgg there I got a standred oAuth Twitter connection screen,
  I allowed myself to connect to account.Then twitter provided my a pin that authenticates the connection between the client app my Twitter account.
4)I posted the pin mantioned there on python shell and then I got 
   access_token_key='241804566-h5jVW2k4pWdlb9vdaUOhVUc5SvylQsSTceANNXaA',
   access_token_secret='QhpQw3rDx3N6npzAIc8wnsbTvNKIfJKXhh4FKSfSj8'
   Then I created a file first.py (attached) using Consumer Key,Consumer Secret,Access token and Access token Secret.
5) finally got my First tweet with python.
